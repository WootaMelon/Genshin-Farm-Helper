# Genshin-Farm-Helper
Mobile Dev Final Project

Backend APIs, Including the database are found in the Backend folder.

Excluded some files as they should be initialized in any ionic project using ionic serve

The app is pretty simple in terms of walkthrough, just follow the sequential flow of the pages. Menu is present in some pages for navigation.

Project needed more styling but due to health and personal reasons, final edits were omitted.
